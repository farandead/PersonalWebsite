Here is a selection of projects that I have worked on, spanning various aspects of computer science and software development.

## [Litigat8](https://github.com/farandead/Litigate)
*A natural language processing (NLP) application leveraging Pinecone, Langchain, and Transformer technologies to provide legal assistance by answering queries related to household and tenant law.*


## [Hunter and Prey RL](https://github.com/yourusername/hunter-prey-rl)
*An exploration into reinforcement learning techniques applied to game AI, specifically focusing on the Hunter and Prey scenario. Utilized Unity for game development and trained AI models using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.*

## [Stock Prediction](https://github.com/farandead/Stock-Prediction)
*A machine learning model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) sequential mode built with Keras for predicting stock prices. Integrated with Streamlit and Matplotlib for visualization and analysis of stock market trends.*


## [Facial Recognition Attendence System](https://github.com/yourusername/facial-recognition)
*A facial recognition-based attendance system designed specifically for university students. Implemented using Python Flask and a facial recognition library, with a focus on convenience and accuracy for managing student attendance.*
