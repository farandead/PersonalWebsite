Here is a selection of projects that I have worked on, spanning various aspects of computer science and software development.

## [Litigat8](https://github.com/farandead/Litigate)
*A natural language processing (NLP) application leveraging Pinecone, Langchain, and Transformer technologies to provide legal assistance by answering queries related to household and tenant law.*

## [Linux Utility Scripts](https://github.com/farandead/scriptingProject)
*A collection of Python scripts developed for Linux systems, automating tasks such as network monitoring, code compilation, file transfer, and generating metadata for directories. These tools aim to streamline system management and enhance productivity for Linux users.*
## [Jiu-Jitsu Academy Website](https://github.com/farandead/sam-sam-jiu-jitsu) - [Live Site](https://6716e0b9249012f363c3e196--sam-sam-ji-jitsu.netlify.app/)
*A React-based website currently under development for a jiu-jitsu academy, incorporating Firebase for real-time data handling and user authentication, along with Flask as the backend. This project includes features like class booking, schedule management, and user communication, aiming to provide a seamless experience for both students and instructors.*

## [Hunter and Prey RL](https://github.com/farandead/hunter-prey-rl)
*An exploration into reinforcement learning techniques applied to game AI, specifically focusing on the Hunter and Prey scenario. Utilized Unity for game development and trained AI models using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.*

## [Stock Prediction](https://github.com/farandead/AI_Stock_Market)
*A machine learning model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) sequential mode built with Keras for predicting stock prices. Integrated with Streamlit and Matplotlib for visualization and analysis of stock market trends.*



## [Facial Recognition Attendence System](https://github.com/farandead/facial-recognition)
*A facial recognition-based attendance system designed specifically for university students. Implemented using Python Flask and a facial recognition library, with a focus on convenience and accuracy for managing student attendance.*
